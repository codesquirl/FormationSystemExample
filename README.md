View the [Formation System Plugin](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/6e6c52f5471746f5b5bb55d7998bd849) on the Unreal Marketplace.


**Engine Version: 5.1**  
For older engine versions, see repository [tags](https://github.com/codesquirl/FormationSystemExample/tags).

## Install the Plugin
You shouldn't have to recompile the plugin if you've installed it to the engine version you are using.

To check that it's installed in Epic Launcher, goto your library and click the 'Installed Plugins' under the version of UE you're using.
You should see the plugin listed there.

If you don't see it, you need to install it to the engine. Search for the plugin in your vault, and click 'Install to Engine'
Then you can open or start a new project. Make sure the plugin is enabled once you have opened the editor.

If you are having trouble opening the example project, you may need to recompile it from your IDE.

Find the project in Windows Explorer, right-click on the .uproject file and select 'Generate Visual Studio project files...'

Once that is done, double click the .sln file to open it in your IDE. 

When the project has loaded, right click the 'FormationExample' project and select 'Build selected project'

Once the project has been built, you should be able to open it.
